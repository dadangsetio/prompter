## What We Have Learned

During the development of the `prompter` project, we have gained valuable insights:

1. Developing decentralized applications (dApps) using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).
2. Integrating advanced AI into blockchain applications.
3. Utilizing Motoko for smart contract development.
4. Managing state and inter-canister interactions within the ICP ecosystem.
5. Implementing an NFT system for conversation topics.

## Challenges We Faced

Some key challenges we encountered during development:

1. Balancing performance and computational costs when integrating AI with blockchain.
2. Managing complex application state across multiple canisters.
3. Implementing robust security measures to protect user data and conversation integrity.
4. Optimizing cycle usage to maintain cost-efficient operations.
5. Designing an intuitive user interface for AI interactions in a blockchain context.

## What We're Proud Of

We take great pride in several achievements in this project:

1. Successfully integrating advanced AI with blockchain technology, creating a unique and secure conversational experience.
2. Implementing an NFT system for conversation topics, adding value and ownership for users.
3. Creating a scalable and efficient architecture, allowing for future growth.
4. Developing a fully on-chain solution, demonstrating the full potential of the Internet Computer.
5. Collaborating effectively as a team, combining our expertise to create an innovative product.


## Get Started
To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `prompter`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)
- [Motoko Package Manager](https://mops.one)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd prompter/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
mops install
dfx deps deploy
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
